            Hi, my name is ******* and I am from <span class="Pulse">Paris</span>, France//I have spent my entire life in France, except for my travels, in many countries. I am East Asian, while keeping a part of me French. In <span class="Pulse">2021</span>, suffering from an immeasurable boredom, I decided to start learning development, especially in Phyton, CSS3 and HTML5. Considering my taste and level in programming, as well as in IT, I wish to continue my undergraduate studies in the same field: <span class="Pulse">Computer</span> Science. Moreover, having a strong ethno-cultural background, has made me aquire a fairly good level in several langages: <br>• French <br> • English<br> •    German<br> •    Mandarin<br>
